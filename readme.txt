== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The submit button doesnt work? =
You have javascript errors on your theme either from the theme itself or an installed plugin. You can troubleshoot this by hitting F12 and checking the browser console.

= Why is the user-interface not displaying correctly? =
Your theme's style.css might be interfering with the default css of the plugin. Or one of the other installed plugins is interfearing with the styling. Please ask support for help

= The form element does not convert into the actual field on dropping =
Unfortunately this is one bug that simple wont die
If you drag a form element onto the canvas area (center column) it sometimes doesn't convert into the actual field. This happens mostly if the element is dropped at the very top or bottom of the form. Just drag and drop it little, almost shaking it until it converts. 

= Is there any documentation for this plugin? =
Yes, go to /Nex-Forms/documentation/index.html or view the interactive tutorial to help you on your way to create forms
